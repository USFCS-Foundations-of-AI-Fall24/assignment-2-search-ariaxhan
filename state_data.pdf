Modify your search code so that it instead solves three subproblems: moveToSample, removeSample, and returnToCharger.
You can do this by changing the start state and goal test. How does this change the number of states generated?

Please add a PDF to your repo with the state data for each of the questions above.

Before decomposition:
------BFS generated 23 states.------
-------DFS generated 19 states.------
------DLS generated 19 states.------

After decomposition:

Subproblem 1: Move to Sample
------BFS generated 4 states.------
-------DFS generated 4 states.------

Subproblem 2: Remove Sample
------BFS generated 3 states.------
-------DFS generated 5 states.------

Subproblem 3: Return to Charger
------BFS generated 3 states.------
-------DFS generated 3 states.------

Decomposing the problem into smaller parts results in less states being generated at each step.
